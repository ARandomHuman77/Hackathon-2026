## Inspiration
This project was inspired by our group itself: people from different cultures, 
united by a shared desire to not only improve our coding skills, but also learn 
the foundations of our respective cultures: the language. Fueled by our passion 
for learning, we challenged ourselves to design a game that turns everyday translations 
into a visual experience, fostering linguistic skills and connection. Essentially, our 
goal is to help people from diverse cultural backgrounds become exposed to a wide range 
of languages and encourage friendship.

## What it does
The game displays English words and asks the player to choose the correct translation into 
French, Hindi, and Mandarin from four options by shooting lasers from the UFO. We used engaging 
icons and interactive elements to aid memorization.

## How we built it
We built it in Python and Pygame for the input handling and drawing. A word bank stores English 
words and their translations, and the game randomly selects a word and generates multiple‑choice 
options each round. Custom fonts and images handle the multilingual text and visuals, with simple 
game states for menu, play, and game over.

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, the challenge we faced was to devise an idea that promotes friendship and fosters companionship 
across cultures. We also struggled with our limited knowledge of GitHub and Pygame as beginners.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a team and as beginners, we’re proud of our final creation and the journey that brought it to life; using 
Pygame to build a functional interface and, most importantly, nurturing the deep bond we developed during this 
project.

## What we learned
Along with enhancing our Python capabilities, we also learned to collaborate effectively on a programming project.

## What's next for Lost in Translation
We aspire to build an option that lets users select preferred languages beyond just French, Hindi, and Mandarin.
